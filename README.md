*Shree-v01
This is a Streamlit application named Shree-v01 that leverages the LangChain library and Google's Generative AI to create a conversational interface between a human and an AI assistant named Shree. The application is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal code.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:


pip install streamlit langchain-google-genai
Configuration
Set your Google API key in the environment variable:

export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
Running the Application
Run the Streamlit application using the following command:


streamlit run your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the name of the script containing the provided code.

#Features
The application uses Google's Generative AI and LangChain to create a conversational interface.
The AI assistant, Shree, is designed to be talkative and provides detailed responses based on the conversation history.
The conversation is displayed in a chat format, with messages from both the user and the AI assistant.

#Usage
Upon running the application, you will see the initial greeting message from Shree.
Enter your message in the chat input box.
Shree will respond with a detailed message based on the conversation history.
The conversation history is displayed in the chat window.

#Implementation Details
The application uses Streamlit for the user interface.
The LangChain library is used to manage the conversation history and generate responses.
Google's Generative AI (gemini-pro model) is employed to generate AI assistant responses.
The conversation is stored in the application's session state, allowing for continuity between user interactions.
Feel free to explore and enhance the application by modifying the code according to your requirements
